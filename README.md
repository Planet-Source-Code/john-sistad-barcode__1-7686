## barcode

### Description

I looked high and low for some type of code snip that showed how to create a barcode (none where available except the ones for sale). So here is one way to print a code 39 barcode in VB. It has worked for me, although very little testing was done.
 
### More Info
 
This program uses a picture box and uses picturebox1.line to draw the barcode.
